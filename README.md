# BIT/MEM

**Memory, risk review, learning, and proof infrastructure for AI trading agents.**

BIT/MEM is not a trading bot. It is the layer that existing trading agents call before and after they act. Agents keep their own strategy, wallet, market data, and execution system. BIT/MEM gives them persistent memory, pre-execution safety review, failure learning, API-key scoped access, MCP tools, and 0G proof anchoring.

Built for the 0G hackathon.

## Casper Agentic Buildathon Reframe

BIT/MEM can also be submitted to the Casper Agentic Buildathon as a memory-backed guardrail and audit layer for Casper agents using x402 payments, MCP tools, CSPR.trade-style DeFi actions, and agent-built workflows.

The Casper adapter adds `sdk.casper` for x402 quote memory, MCP tool-call memory, agent spend policies, and pre-action reviews that return `ALLOW`, `WARN`, `BLOCK`, or `REQUIRE_HUMAN`.

Start with:

```bash
npm run example:casper
```

Submission notes:

- `CASPER_SUBMISSION.md`

## Bitget AI Hackathon Add-On

This repo now includes a Bitget AI Trading Infrastructure adapter for the same product.

The new `sdk.bitget` module lets Bitget Agent Hub / MCP / CLI workflows write market snapshots, position snapshots, and tool-call observations into BIT/MEM, then review proposed Bitget futures orders against guardrails before execution.

Best submission angle for Bitget Track 2:

```text
BIT/MEM x Bitget Agent Hub: memory-backed risk and audit infrastructure for Bitget AI trading agents.
```

Start with:

```bash
npm run example:bitget
```

- `docs/BITGET_AI_TRACK.md`
- `BITGET_SUBMISSION.md`

## Live Backend

The public Railway backend exposes REST and Streamable HTTP MCP on one domain:

```text
REST API: https://bitmem-backend-production.up.railway.app/v1
MCP URL:  https://bitmem-backend-production.up.railway.app/mcp
Health:   https://bitmem-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
```

SDK clients should use `baseUrl: "https://bitmem-backend-production.up.railway.app"`.
MCP clients should use the `/mcp` URL with the agent API key as the bearer token.

## What This Website Can Do

The web app is the operator control plane for BIT/MEM.

### Landing Page

The landing page explains the product boundary clearly:

- BIT/MEM is infrastructure for agents, not an auto-trading agent.
- It provides memory, safety, learning, and proof.
- It shows how SDK, API, MCP, 0G Storage, 0G Compute, and 0G Chain fit together.
- It gives judges and developers the product story without needing to read code first.

### Dashboard

The dashboard shows only real workspace data. It does not show seeded fake memories.

It can:

- show saved memory records for the logged-in workspace
- show connected agent count based on real memory data
- show source counts for SDK, MCP, REST API, and manual dashboard entries
- display a bubble map of memory by source and agent
- show exactly where a selected memory came from
- manually add memory for an agent
- save manual memory through the authenticated API
- run a sample Aegis transaction review
- display the review decision, risk score, reason, and proof provider
- show provenance for all visible memory
- link users to the connection guide
- link users to API key management

### API Keys Page

The API Keys page is the identity and access layer for connected agents.

It can:

- create API keys for trading agents
- show the raw API key secret once
- copy the secret to clipboard
- list active and revoked keys
- revoke keys
- show active key count
- show revoked key count
- show last-used information when available
- explain how to use the key from SDK, MCP, and REST clients

Why this matters: the API has to know whose memory belongs to whom. Dashboard users log in with email. Agents use API keys. Every memory written by an agent is scoped to that authenticated workspace.

### Connect Page

The Connect page shows how real agents integrate with BIT/MEM.

It can:

- switch between SDK, MCP, and REST integration paths
- show install commands
- show copyable quick-start commands
- show minimal code snippets
- explain the runtime workflow:
  1. save memory
  2. fetch context
  3. review plan
  4. execute or stop
  5. record outcome
- show 0G mainnet proof registry status
- link to the API Keys page for credentials
- link to the live 0G checklist

### Email Login

The local hackathon auth flow supports email confirmation.

In dev mode, requesting login returns a confirmation link that can be opened immediately. After login, the dashboard can create API keys for agents. The API stores hashes of secrets, not raw API keys.

## What Agents Get

Agents can use BIT/MEM through three integration paths:

| Path | Best For | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript SDK | Node or TypeScript agents | Direct memory, profile, context, review, outcome, learning, and proof calls |
| REST API | Python agents, workers, notebooks, hosted services | HTTP access with API-key workspace scoping |
| Streamable HTTP MCP | Claude, Codex, and LLM agents | One URL plus bearer-token tool calls for memory, review, outcome recording, and reflection |

## Product Boundary

BIT/MEM is:

- an SDK for existing AI trading agents
- a memory layer for skills, strategies, policies, trades, and failures
- a safety layer around transaction plans
- a learning layer after failed or skipped execution
- a proof layer for decisions and reports
- an operator dashboard for visibility and access management

BIT/MEM is not:

- a trading agent
- a strategy engine
- a copy-trading platform
- a wallet extension
- a leaderboard for other agents
- a mock bot
- a replacement for an agent's executor

## How It Works

```text
Existing Trading Agent
  |
  | 1. saves strategy, policy, skills, and prior outcomes
  v
BIT/MEM Memory
  |
  | 2. retrieves context before a transaction plan
  v
Aegis Review
  |
  | 3. decodes calldata, checks policy, asks private compute for reasoning
  v
Decision
  |
  | ALLOW / WARN / BLOCK / REQUIRE_HUMAN
  v
Agent Executor or Human Review
  |
  | 4. records outcome, failures, and lessons
  v
BIT/MEM Learning + Proofs
```

## Core Modules

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `bitmem.memory` | Add and search structured memories |
| `bitmem.context` | Retrieve relevant memories before a trade plan |
| `bitmem.profile` | Return stable agent profile plus dynamic context |
| `aegis.risk` | Review transaction plans before execution |
| `trades` | Record executed, failed, reverted, or skipped outcomes |
| `learning` | Reflect on failures and store lessons |
| `proofs` | Generate local proofs or anchor decisions on 0G Chain |
| `casper` | Store Casper x402/MCP observations and review proposed agent actions |
| `bitget` | Ingest Bitget Agent Hub observations and review proposed Bitget futures orders |
| `BitMemApiClient` | Use the hosted/local API through agent API keys |
| `mcp` | Expose BIT/MEM as tools to LLM agents |
| `web` | Operator UI for dashboard, API keys, and connections |

## Memory Types

BIT/MEM stores the kinds of context an autonomous trading agent needs before it touches money:

- `agent_profile`
- `skill`
- `strategy`
- `policy`
- `trade_plan`
- `executed_trade`
- `risk_report`
- `blocked_action`
- `failure_lesson`
- `human_feedback`
- `protocol_profile`

## Aegis Review

Aegis is the safety layer around a trading agent. It reviews a transaction plan and returns:

- `ALLOW`
- `WARN`
- `BLOCK`
- `REQUIRE_HUMAN`

Deterministic checks include:

- unlimited ERC20 approvals
- approval amount above policy
- unknown spender
- unknown recipient
- unknown protocol contract
- blocked calldata selector
- selector outside an allowlist
- native value above policy
- transaction batch size limit
- missing trusted protocol context
- repeated failure patterns through memory retrieval

The review also asks the compute layer for private reasoning when 0G Compute credentials are configured.

## How 0G Is Used

### 0G Storage

0G Storage is the intended durable memory layer for memory artifacts, policies, profiles, risk reports, outcomes, and failure lessons.

The SDK currently ships with:

- local in-memory storage
- JSON file storage
- optional 0G Storage adapter in `packages/sdk/src/storage-0g.ts`

Local/file mode keeps the hackathon demo easy to run. The storage adapter is where live 0G Storage credentials plug in.

### 0G Compute Router / Private Computer Direction

BIT/MEM uses 0G Compute Router as the private reasoning interface when `OG_COMPUTE_API_KEY` is configured.

Used for:

- risk explanation during Aegis review
- failure reflection after a failed/reverted/skipped plan
- private reasoning over strategy, policy, transaction, and memory context

Honest status: this repo uses the Router-compatible compute integration today. It does not yet implement a deeper direct TEE-specific 0G Private Computer workflow beyond the Router abstraction.

### 0G Chain

0G Chain anchors compact proof records for risk decisions.

The deployed proof registry is:

```text
0xCbc3AE7d33c2F6E2600E0F9E3fE1610DD84E14A5
```

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npm
- Git

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run API

```bash
npm run api:dev
```

Expected output:

```text
BIT/MEM API listening on http://localhost:8787
0G proof registry enabled at 0xCbc3AE7d33c2F6E2600E0F9E3fE1610DD84E14A5
```

If port `8787` is already in use, the API is already running or another process owns the port.

### Run Website

```bash
npm run web:dev
```

Open:

```text

```

## SDK Usage

```ts
import { BitMem } from "@bit-mem/sdk";

const mem = new BitMem();

await mem.memory.add({
  agentId: "agent-risk-03",
  kind: "policy",
  title: "Approval ceiling",
  content: {
    maxTokenApprovalAmount: "1000000000",
    trustedSpenders: ["0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111"]
  },
  tags: ["policy", "approval"]
});

const context = await mem.context.forTradePlan({
  agentId: "agent-risk-03",
  intent: "Approve USDC before entering a vault",
  txs
});

const verdict = await mem.aegis.risk.reviewPlan({
  agentId: "agent-risk-03",
  intent: "Approve USDC before entering a vault",
  txs,
  context
});

if (verdict.decision !== "ALLOW") {
  throw new Error(verdict.reason);
}
```

## API Client Usage

Create an API key at `/#api-keys`, then use it from an agent runtime.

```ts
import { BitMemApiClient } from "@bit-mem/sdk";

const client = new BitMemApiClient({
  apiKey: process.env.BITMEM_API_KEY,
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8787"
});

await client.memory.add({
  agentId: "agent-arb-01",
  kind: "strategy",
  title: "ETH/USDC rebalance rules",
  content: {
    maxTradeUsd: 500,
    maxSlippageBps: 75
  }
});

const review = await client.aegis.risk.reviewPlan({
  agentId: "agent-arb-01",
  intent: "Rebalance ETH/USDC",
  txs
});
```

## REST API

The API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

Authenticated agent routes accept:

```text
Authorization: Bearer bitmem_live_...
```

Routes:

| Method | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | API health |
| `POST` | `/auth/request-login` | Create email confirmation link |
| `GET` | `/auth/verify?token=...` | Verify dashboard session |
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | Current dashboard user and API keys |
| `POST` | `/api-keys` | Create an API key |
| `DELETE` | `/api-keys/:id` | Revoke an API key |
| `POST` | `/memory` | Add memory |
| `GET` | `/memory?agentId=...` | Search/list memory |
| `GET` | `/profile?agentId=...` | Get agent profile |
| `POST` | `/context` | Retrieve context for a trade plan |
| `POST` | `/review-plan` | Run Aegis review and proof recording |
| `POST` | `/trades/outcome` | Record execution outcome |
| `POST` | `/learning/reflect` | Create a failure lesson |

## Streamable HTTP MCP

Run the API and the Streamable HTTP MCP server:

```bash
npm run api:dev
npm run mcp:http:dev
```

Local MCP URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp
```

Codex, Claude, or any Streamable HTTP MCP client should use:

```json
{
  "name": "bitmem",
  "type": "streamable-http",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8788/mcp",
  "bearerTokenEnvVar": "BITMEM_API_KEY"
}
```

The bearer token is the agent API key created in the dashboard. The MCP server
expects `Authorization: Bearer <BIT/MEM API key>` and writes to that authenticated
workspace.

For public demos, host the API/MCP backend and use its HTTPS endpoint:

```text
https://bitmem-backend-production.up.railway.app/mcp
```

Tools exposed:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `bitmem_add_memory` | Store policy, strategy, trade, feedback, protocol, risk, or lesson memory |
| `bitmem_get_profile` | Return stable profile plus recent dynamic memory |
| `bitmem_context_for_trade_plan` | Retrieve context before risk review |
| `aegis_review_plan` | Return ALLOW, WARN, BLOCK, or REQUIRE_HUMAN |
| `bitmem_record_outcome` | Record executed, failed, reverted, or skipped outcomes |
| `bitmem_reflect_failure` | Create a failure lesson from outcome and context |
